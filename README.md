# Lead_scoring_case_study
The Main objective of this case study is to improve the conversion rate of incoming leads. 
An EdTech company named as X Education needs help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein we have to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. X education is targeting the lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
